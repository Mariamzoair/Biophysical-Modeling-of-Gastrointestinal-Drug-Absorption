# Biophysical Modeling of Gastrointestinal Drug Absorption

## Project Overview

This project explores advanced biophysical and computational modeling techniques to simulate drug absorption in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. It was developed as a final report for **BE-GY 6113 â€“ Spring 2025**, by students of the Tandon School of Engineering, Department of Biomedical Engineering.

We propose an integrated approach combining:
- Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) Modeling  
- Convectionâ€“Diffusion Equations  
- Permeability-Limited Absorption Models  
- Stochastic Transit Models  
- Microbiome-based Variability Modeling

These methods aim to improve the accuracy of oral drug delivery simulations and support the development of personalized therapeutics.

## Modeling Summary

The model simulates drug movement, degradation, and absorption through the GI tract using:

1. **Convectionâ€“Diffusionâ€“Degradation Equation** â€“ for luminal drug distribution  
2. **Absorption Flux Equation** â€“ for trans-epithelial drug transport  
3. **Compartmental Transit Model** â€“ for region-wise drug progression

The model is parameterized using physiological values (e.g., pH, surface area, permeability) and solved numerically using MATLAB-based ODE/PDE solvers.

## Validation Methods

- **In vitro**: Caco-2 assays, gut-on-a-chip platforms  
- **In silico**: Sensitivity analysis and parameter tuning  
- **Drug case studies**: e.g., midazolam metabolism

## Conclusion

This biophysical modeling framework offers a more detailed and accurate representation of gastrointestinal drug absorption. It supports improved predictions of oral drug behavior and offers a platform for developing personalized medicine strategies.
